								<p style="text-align: center;">This guy</p>
								<p>For starters, I'm a Singaporean Game Developer and Software Engineer from DigiPen. </p>
								<p>Growing up, I always enjoyed playing video games and was fascinated by the whole process.
									 My first programming experience actually came from trying to code and host an IRC chat bot when I was 15.
									 Looking back now, the process was quite simple but I can remember the joy I had from getting something
									  as simple as "Hi [Username]" to show up and being proud of that.
									   I decided that I would want to make a career in the IT field and when I was doing my diploma,
									    I decided to major in Games Development to pursue a passion of mine. </p>
								<p>It's been 11 years later and now I can do a lot more than that. Through my programming years, I worked on plenty of projects, ranging from developing games on Unity/Unreal/proprietary game engines to developing prototypes for my employers. </p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy unwinding with a good game/movie, cycling or cooking.</p>
